Hey {{ player.user.first_name }}!

The tournament has started! As was sent out earlier, there
are no set times for your matches, just play when you can.
To find out which games you need to play, go to your player
information under http://www.cttabletennis.com/tournament/players/.
We have a long document describing rules on the web page, but
here's a reminder of some of the more salient points:

  - Any game you play with someone who is on your "upcoming"
    matches is a tournament match--you can only practice with
    players from other divisions.

  - Score cards and pens will be on the windowsill near the
    table. Please fill them out while you're playing your
    match so that we can get scores from all sets. Either
    hand one of us the cards or email us the scores and we'll
    save the information on the web site.

  - For now, a match consists of a best-of-3 sets, which each
    set played to 21.

  - Upon deuce (both teams having 20 points), the serving
    alternation pattern is 1, 2, 2... until one team has two
    more points than the other team.

  - Referees are not necessary-- we're honest here. Disputes
    can result in a "do-over" of a point.

  - (For doubles) Lines are counted as "in".

  - The strict rules for throwing a ball while serving are not
    going to be enforced during division playoffs, but will be
    expected to be followed during the next stage.

  - Here are your upcoming matches:
{% for team in player.get_teams %}{% with team.matches.1 as future %}{% if future %}{% for match in future %}
    * {% if team.player2 %}{{ team|safe }}{% else %}You{% endif %} vs. {{ match.other_team|safe }}{% endfor %}{% endif %}{% endwith %}{% endfor %}
